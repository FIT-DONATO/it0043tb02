              <h3>There once lived a pirate named Gol D. Roger. He obtained
                wealth, fame, and power to earn
                the title of Pirate King. When he was captured and about to be
                executed, he revealed that his
                treasure called One Piece was hidden somewhere at the Grand
                Line. This made all people set out
                to search and uncover the One Piece treasure, but no one ever
                found the location of Gol D. Roger's
                treasure, and the Grand Line was too dangerous a place to
                overcome. Twenty-two years after Gol D.
                Roger's death, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy decided to become a
                pirate and search for Gol D. Roger's
                treasure to become the next Pirate King.

                  <p id="deets">One Piece has introduced a surprising number of
                    devil fruits into the series, each serving its own unique
                    purpose. While some devil fruits can turn the most skilled
                    fighters into absolute powerhouses, others can make the user
                    a
                    one-person wrecking crew. Shiro Shiro no Mi falls into the
                    latter category. The fruit was responsible for Capone Bege’s
                    fame and infamy in the One Piece series.</p>

                    Update</p>
                  <p id="deets">If you believed our ship would sink as we sail
                    across the Grand Line, think again. Netflix's One Piece is
                    letting down and sails and going even further. The
                    live-action
                    anime adaptation dropped on Netflix last year and became an
                    instant success, breaking records for the streamer early on.
                    With over 18.5 million views and over 140 million hours
                    watched
                    in its first week, One Piece was soon renewed for a second
                    season soon after. Now it seems Netflix will hoist the
                    colors
                    of
                    the show even higher, as the third season will be filmed
                    straight after the second, according to one of its
                    stars.</p>
